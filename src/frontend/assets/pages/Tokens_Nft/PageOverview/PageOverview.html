                            We started with the project name 5000 Slices.
                            <br>                            
                            And the first token was SLI (DIP20 standard) with a maximum supply of 5000 tokens. 
                            After a short time we created the second token GLDS (DIP20 standard) with a maximum supply of 3000 tokens. 
                            And this token was distributed as a reward for users who staked their SLI tokens. 
                            We also created Slices NFT (with max NFT supply of 50 pieces) which will be used in the near future.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">New Tokens:</p>
                            Our two tokens SLI and GLDS were only DIP-20 standard tokens, so we decided to switch to ICRC tokens. We forked the Sneed ICRC repository and extended the code base to implement the ICRC2 standard and some additional features. 
                            In our corresponding                          
                            <a href="https://github.com/5000slices1/ICRC1-Implementation-with-tests" style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);font-weight: bold;" >ICRC token GitHub repository</a>  
                            you will notice that the title and description only mention ICRC1, but ICRC2 has also been implemented. (We haven't updated the text on github yet)

                            The new tokens are called 'Trabyter' and 'Trabyter Premium', they have exactly the same supply as the old tokens.
                            Then the question arose how to convert/exchange the old tokens to the new ones. 
                            Our idea was that the old tokens should be burned after the conversion process and so we created a SwapApp called
                            <a href="https://swapapp.trabyter.com/" style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);font-weight: bold;" >'Trabyter SwapApp'</a>
                            which will handle the conversion process. 
                            Our intention was to make this app user-friendly and transparent. 
                            <br><br>
                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Project Rebranding to 'Trabyter':</p>
                             Our main product will be a marketplace where it is possible to buy and sell bundled NFT'.
                             So trading by barter, and therefore we rebranded the project to 'Trabyter'.
                             Our next app will be the Trabyter NFT Staking app. (So that our NFT holders can stake their NFT's and earn rewards)
                             And after the NFT staking app we will start coding our main app the Trabyter Marketplace.
                             Our tokens will have usage in the Trabyter Marketplace and in the Trabyter NFT Staking app.
                             (We do not want to publish the details of the Trabyter NFT Staking and Marketplace app yet, because we want to keep it secret until the release)
